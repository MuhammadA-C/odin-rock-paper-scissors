The Odin Project : Foundations : Rock Paper Scissors Project

Note: I decided to redo The Odin Project - Foundations course since I only completed up to ~80% last time, and I wanted to complete it this time.

Overview: This project is supposed to allow a player play against the computer in a game of rock, paper, and scissors. For this version of the project creating a GUI wasn't required, so the information is displayed in the console and input is entered via a prompt box.
