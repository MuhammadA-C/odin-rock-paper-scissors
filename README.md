The Odin Project : Foundations : Rock Paper Scissors Project

---

*Note: I decided to redo The Odin Project - Foundations course since I only completed up to ~80% last time, and I wanted to complete it this time.*

**Overview:** This project is supposed to allow a player play against the computer in a game of rock, paper, and scissors. 

**GUI:**
For this version of the project, we were supposed to create the game to run in the console, so no GUI was required.

**Playing The Game:**
The user is able to play the game by typing into the promot box either "rock", "paper", or "scissors". 

**Input Checking:**
Users input is case insensitive, so the user can enter in the choices of rock, paper, or scissors in a variety of ways and the input will work.
I handled this by after obtaining the user input to convert it all to lowercase.
